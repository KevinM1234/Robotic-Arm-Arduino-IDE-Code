# Robotic-Arm-Arduino-IDE-Code
The robot arm was deigned to function with one of two programs I created. The first uses potentiometers to function as a controller for each axis it can move along. The other program uses inverse kinematic equations to take an input location (coordinate point)and move the end of the arm to that location. The system is run through an Arduino. 
The file titled Roboarm involves inverse kinematics and the file titled MotorwithKnobs is for using three potentiometers.
