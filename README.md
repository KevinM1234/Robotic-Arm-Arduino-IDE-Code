# Robotic-Arm-Arduino-IDE-Code
The two programs I created to use the robotic arm either with potentiometers or inverse kinematics. Both programs are simple but work for their intended use.
The file titled Roboarm involves inverse kinematics and the file titled MotorwithKnobs is for using three potentiometers.
